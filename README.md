# Crimson Orange Library and Benchmarking Tool

Hello and welcome to Crimson Orange's Library and Benchmarking Tool

This is a separate testing tool to test libraries which can be used in Honoka environment.
Simply, this is an unrefined but working pathfinder algorithm bundle, including Dijkstra, Best-First-Search and A*, which will be used alongside Honoka.

It's nicknamed RinPana to match the Honoka's nickname.
